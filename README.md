# Welcome :wave:

It has been a while since I have setup a React project from scratch. I wanted to explore some of the new tooling in the ecosystem. This project will utilize Vite & RTK (redux toolkit) as my primary focus for exploring new options. However it will contain a whole host of other fun stuff such as styled-components, jest, Typescript, babel (considered SWC, but wanted to focus on the primary two first), & more!
