# Welcome :wave:

It has been a while since I have setup a React project from scratch. I wanted to explore some of the new tooling in the ecosystem. This project will utilize Vite & RTK (redux toolkit) as my primary focus for exploring new options.

## Disclaimer :warning:
This is not meant to be a beautiful UI, it is mainly focused on using RTK and learning more about that alongside Vite.
